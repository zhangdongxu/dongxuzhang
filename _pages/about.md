I am a machine learning scientist at <a href="https://www.optum.com/en/"> Optum </a>. Previously I was a research scientist at <a href="https://www.asapp.com/"> ASAPP </a> where I worked on modeling the AI agent and its safety guardrails for call centers. I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/"> Computer Science at Umass Amherst </a>, working with Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>. My thesis topic is to represent graphs in a compact, geometric-based embedding space. I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning.

During my research career, I have had great pleasure collaborating with <a href="https://yiyangnlp.github.io/">Yi Yang</a>,  <a href="https://vgtomahawk.github.io/">Varun Gangal</a>, <a href="https://www.mboratko.com/">Michael Boratko</a>, <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~xiangl/">Lorraine Li</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ULmldMQAAAAJ&hl=en">Sunil Mohan</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/submukhe/">Subhabrata  Mukherjee</a>, <a href="https://lunadong.com/">Luna Dong</a>, <a href="http://123.56.88.210/">Sujian Li</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bzUAoWIAAAAJ&hl=en">Dong Wang</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iZZfm-8AAAAJ&hl=en">Weiran Xu</a>
